# Data Science Workshop  -  Machine learning in [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) - 

The “Machine learning in **R**” workshop on the **23. May 2018**  is aimed at participants already familiar with the basics of R. The first part (~ 1 hour) will introduce participants to the basic concepts of supervised (classification / regression) and unsupervised (clustering) learning. Afterwards you will learn how to conveniently and efficiently apply the most common machine learning techniques of the [mlr](https://mlr-org.github.io/) package. 
Our instructor, [Jakob Richter](http://jakob-r.de/) is an experienced data scientists and as a co-developer of mlr knows the ins and outs of the package. He will demonstrate some of its key features on a practical example enabling you to apply mlr on your problems to find a good pefrorming prediction mode and to tweak its performance using mlrs tuning algorithms.

Curriculum:

1. Theoretical introduction: 1 hour introduction to the basic concepts of machine learning:
   - Classification.
   - Regression.
2. Machine Learning in R using mlr.
   - Introduction to the basic principles of mlr.
   - Performance validation methods.
   - Benchmarking of machine learning algorithms.
   - Advanced methods: What are Wrappers, why do you need them and how to use them to build ensembles and basic preprocessing pipelines.

The workshop is part of the two conferences:

  * [International Biotech Innovation Days](https://ibid-2018.b2match.io/), wich will take place from the 23 - 25 May 2018 in [Senftenberg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senftenberg) at the [Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus – Senftenberg](https://www.b-tu.de/en/) (Campus Senftenberg) and
  * the [WhyR annual meeting of Polish R community](http://whyr2018.pl/).
